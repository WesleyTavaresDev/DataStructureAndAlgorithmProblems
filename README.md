# Data Strucures and Algorithms

## List and Strings

1. Write a function that returns the largest element in a list.

```go

input: arr := [3]int{1, 3, 2}

output: 3

```

***

2. Write function that reverses a list, preferably in place.

```go

input: arr := [3]int{5, 2, 4}

output: [4, 2, 5]

```

***

3. Write a function that checks whether an element occurs in a list.

```go

inputs: arr := []int{10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 65, 3}, target := 30

output: true

```

***

4. Write a function that computes the running total of a list.

```go

inputs: arr := []int{2, 4, 6, 8, 20}

output: [2, 6, 12, 20, 40]


```
